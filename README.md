- 🕹️ I’m currently working on [MangoKart](https://github.com/cs107e/winter24-project-SuperAce100-ethanboneh), a 3D game and graphics engine built from pure scratch (bare metal) on the RISC-V powered Mango Pi.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying **computer graphics, embedded systems, robotics, deep learning, and mathematics**

- 🦼 I really enjoyed working on the [Gaze-to-Life Eye Controlled Wheelchair for Paralysed People](https://github.com/SuperAce100/eye-controlled-wheelchair-controls)

- 🎥 Something else cool I've built lets me [add text to videos programmatically](https://github.com/SuperAce100/add-text)

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [asanshay.com](asanshay.com)
